## Admin in a day

# M03-HOL-Action through Automation

## Lab Scenario

In this hands-on lab, you are an administrator supporting Contoso's efforts to streamline and control Power Platform usage. Contoso has restricted environment creation to global or service admins and wants an automated process for users to request new environments and Dataverse databases without discouraging platform adoption. You will build a Microsoft Form for users to submit requests, and then use Power Automate with administrative connectors and approval workflows to automate the review and provisioning process. The solution will handle approvals, environment creation, and user notifications. You’ll also explore the app auditing process from the CoE Starter Kit by stepping through it as both a maker and an admin, and install a prebuilt flow to identify new app makers, add them to an Office 365 group, and send them a welcome email.


## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1 - Create Environment Request Form
- Exercise 2 – Create Environment on Form Submit
- Exercise 3 – Welcome New Makers (Optional if you have time)

### Lab Test Environment

This hands-on lab is designed to be completed in an environment setup for multiple students to complete the Admin in a day series of hands-on labs.

You will be assigned one or more users to use to complete the hands-on tasks. Because this is a shared environment, some tasks that require a tenant Global Administrator or a Service 
Administrator will already be performed.

This lab does not require you to have completed any of the prior labs.

## Exercise 1: Create Environment Request Form

### Scenario

In this exercise, you will be creating an environment request form using Microsoft Forms. This form could
collect additional information allowing it to be tailored to your individual organization's requirements.

### Task 1: Create Microsoft Form

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Forms** with the following link https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx and if prompted, close the pop up screen.

2. Select **+ New Form**.

   ![](images/M02/pp52.png)

    ![](images/M03/pp61.png)


## Exercise 2: Create Environment on Form Submit

### Scenario

In this exercise, you will be building the automated flow to process new form submissions.

**Note**: For this exercise, we have hard-coded the language, currency and environment template. The Power Platform Administration connector has actions allowing you to 
dynamically retrieve these and make the process more flexible. You could allow the user to specify the values, or infer them from the user’s Office 365 profile information using 
the Office 365 connector.

### Task 1: Delete your sandbox environment

## CoE Environment Management Sample Implementation

#### The CoE starter kit includes a sample implementation of an environment management process you can tailor to your own needs. The following diagram illustrates the high-level process.

![](images/M03/M3-EX3-overview.png)

##### You can learn more about the details in How to use the Environment Management components - Power Platform | Microsoft Docs

##### Using the starter kit process can save you time, but as you saw in Exercises 1 and 2 the platform also supports you in building your custom processes.

## Exercise 3: Welcome New Makers (Optional if you have time)
